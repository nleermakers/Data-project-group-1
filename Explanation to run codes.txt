To scrape tweets:
1. run main code
2. run scrape_tweets_DATABASE (tweets are saved in a postgreSQL database)

3. Data from postgreSQL database should be converted to a CSV file, called postgres_output. This file should be within the folder 'Location code'.

To identify locations and neighbourhoods:
4. run location code > location_searcher
5. Results.csv is the final output.
